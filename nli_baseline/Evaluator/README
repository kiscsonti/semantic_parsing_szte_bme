Evaluator Notebook for results calculated in your codes.

It will plot your Fscores, Precisions and Recalls for all 3 categories.
It will also list outliers at the bottom, and group Entailment and Contradiction into a Relation category,
and give you statistics on that as well.

The Input file that contains your similarity scores has to be in the following format.: (can also be seen in Results.txt)
Each line contains one float between 1 and -1
the closer to one, the more confident you are it is entailment, 
the closer to -1 the more confident you are in contradiction
the closer to 0 you are, the more confident you are in the sentence pair being neutral

The NLI file you processed has to be put (jsonline version of it) in it's proper place,
so is your file containing the results. 

After that, just run the notebook, and observe the results.
